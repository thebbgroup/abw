                    <p>Back by popular demand, the BeatBullying blue wristbands are once again available for schools to order now. Wearing a BeatBullying wristband is a great way to make your pupils feel part of your anti-bullying strategy and help them feel safe at your school. Â It's also an excellent way to demonstrate your school's commitment to tackling bullying, in line with Ofsted's Inspection Framework.

                    You can buy your bands in packs of 50 or 100 to give out to all your pupils, or sell back to your students to raise funds for your school.
